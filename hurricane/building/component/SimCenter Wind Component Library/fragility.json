    "Comments": "The study uses a light-frame residential building archetype to assess hurricane damage in Port St. Lucie, FL. Damage analysis described in this study does not explicitly model or account for the effects of wind-borne debris. The archetype building is 8.5m (28 ft) by 12.2m (40 ft), one story, with a mean roof height of 3.8m (12.5 ft) and a roof type of 6:12 slope gable roof without overhang. Roof sheathing panels are nailed at a spacing of 150mm at the edges. The steel fasteners used are assumed to be hot-dip galvanized to ASTM A153, Class D, with a zinc coating thickness of 43 mm. Panels are nailed to structural trusses or rafters made of spruce-pine-fir (SPF) lumber, spaced 0.6m on center with a specific gravity of 0.36. \n\nLIMITATIONS: The building archetype may not represent the diversity of real-world residential structures and ages within a community. Further, the study does not account for complex terrain effects on wind loads, potentially limiting the applicability of the findings to more varied real-world scenarios.",

The installation of roof-to-wall straps is considered a mitigation option within the HAZUS-MH model, specifically for single-family residential buildings that currently have toe-nailed roof-wall connections. \n\nLIMITATIONS: A limitation of this capacity function, as with other component resistances in the model, lies in the fact that these are statistical representations based on laboratory data, engineering analyses, and sometimes engineering judgment. Additionally, they do not give a detailed physical description of the straps themselves, such as their dimensions, material, or specific installation methods. The focus is on the functional capacity of the connection rather than a precise engineering specification of the strap itself. The underlying details of what constitutes a \"strap\" in the model's calculations are likely based on engineering standards and typical construction practices, but these specifics are not elaborated upon in the provided excerpts.",

In individual tests, the predominant failure mode observed was nail pullout from the top plate. In system tests, where multiple rafters were toe-nailed to a continuous top plate, load-sharing behavior was observed, with the equivalent rafter load exceeding the capacity of the individual toe-nailed connection. However, the ultimate capacities remained low compared to connections with straps or adhesives. \n\nLIMITATIONS: The high variability observed in individual tests suggests a limitation in the predictability of these connections.

    "Comments": "For configurations with toe-nailed roof-to-wall connections, the model would consider the uplift resistance provided by this type of connection. The failure mode modeled would be the failure of the toe-nailed connection under wind-induced uplift forces, which could lead to subsequent damage such as roof cover loss, roof deck failure, or even more severe structural damage. The model implicitly recognizes the relative weakness of toe-nailed connections compared to strapped connections by considering the installation of straps as a mitigation measure for buildings with existing toe-nailed connections.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The provided sources do not explicitly detail specific test series for roof-to-wall connections using toe nails. The capacity function for toe-nailed connections is a statistical representation of their resistance, derived from laboratory test data, engineering analyses, and potentially engineering judgment, as mentioned for other building components. A key limitation of this capacity function is that it represents a simplified model of a complex failure mechanism and relies on statistical data which may not fully capture the variability in actual construction practices and the performance of toe-nailed connections under diverse hurricane conditions.",

The strap was located on the inside of the wall. Materials included Southern yellow pine double top plates and Southern yellow pine or spruce-pine-fir rafters (#2 grade) at a 3:12 pitch. The predominant failure mode observed for this configuration was block shear in wood. \n\nLIMITATIONS: A key limitation is that this 'new large strap' provided a direct connection from the rafter to the wall stud, bypassing the top plate for the strap's nailed connection, which is different from typical large straps.

    "Comments": "The roof-to-wall connection using toenails and a Simpson Strong-Tie H10 metal connector on every truss. The capacity function for this connection type is based on tests conducted at Clemson University. The primary modeled failure mode for this reinforced connection is the exceedance of this higher uplift resistance by wind-induced forces, which, if it occurs, could still lead to roof uplift or detachment and compromise the building envelope. The Simpson Strong-Tie H10 metal connector is identified as a component used to enhance roof-to-wall connections, thereby increasing their resistance to uplift forces. The use of the Simpson Strong-Tie H10 connector is also associated with the \"Reinforce roof-to-wall connections (IBHS Gold)\" retrofit strategy. This strategy aims to provide an uplift connection for each roof support member to the bearing wall by adding metal connectors, described generally as \"hurricane straps\".\n\nLIMITATIONS: Limitations of this capacity function are not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but it is important to note that as it is based on unpublished tests at a specific university and assumes the use of Simpson Strong-Tie H10 connectors on every truss, its accuracy in representing the full spectrum of real-world installations and conditions might be limited by variations in construction quality, specific connector installation details, and the age and condition of the underlying structural members, none of which are addressed within these sources.

Modeled failure modes for windows on a 2-story building include pressure-induced breakage when the wind load exceeds the window's pressure resistance.\n\nLIMITATIONS: This study does not explicitly specify the type of glass (e.g., annealed, tempered). A limitation of these capacity functions is that they are statistical representations based on laboratory test data, engineering analyses, and in some cases engineering judgment, which may not fully capture the complexities of real-world window installations, the variability in material properties, and the diverse characteristics of windborne debris. The model also simplifies by considering representative building geometries and may not account for specific details of individual windows on a given 2-story structure. The specific size of the window described in the capacity function is not mentioned.",

    "Description": "Regular Window 1/8 in 20 sq ft",
    "Comments": "The study uses a light-frame residential building archetype to assess hurricane damage in Port St. Lucie, FL. Damage analysis described in this study does not explicitly model or account for the effects of wind-borne debris. The archetype building is 8.5m (28 ft) by 12.2m (40 ft), one story, with a mean roof height of 3.8m (12.5 ft). A window size of 3.72 square meters with 3.175 mm thick glass was considered. The authors used the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E-1300 (2003) to specify the strength of annealed glass under uniform wind pressure with a 60-second load duration and a probability of failure of 0.0081. The 60-second resistance value of annealed glass was converted to a 3-second strength by multiplying it by a factor of 1.21. This conversion was done to be consistent with the 3-second gust wind used in ASCE-7. A Weibull cumulative distribution was used to model the probability of failure of the brittle material (glass) under uniform wind load. This is stated as a common model for defining the failure probability of brittle materials like glass. The coefficient of variation of glass strength was noted to be in the range of 0.22\u20130.27.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The building archetype may not represent the diversity of real-world residential structures and ages within a community. Further, the study does not account for complex terrain effects on wind loads, potentially limiting the applicability of the findings to more varied real-world scenarios. Finally, the fragility analysis mentions a specific window size (3.175 mm in 3.72 sq. m window) for calibration. Glass strength is known to be dependent on size and boundary conditions, so the fragility derived for this specific size might not be directly applicable to windows of different dimensions or mounting.",

However, wind loads on buildings, especially during hurricanes, can be complex and non-uniform, with varying pressures at different locations on a window. Additionally, while the study converts the 60-second resistance to a 3-second strength, this conversion factor is an approximation. The actual behavior of glass under different load durations might be more complex. Additionally, the strength of weathered or previously damaged glass might be lower than that of new, undamaged glass, which is likely what ASTM standards address.

    "Comments": "The study uses a light-frame residential building archetype to assess hurricane damage in Port St. Lucie, FL. Damage analysis described in this study does not explicitly model or account for the effects of wind-borne debris. The archetype building is 8.5m (28 ft) by 12.2m (40 ft), one story, with a mean roof height of 3.8m (12.5 ft) and a roof type of 6:12 slope gable roof without overhang. The roof covering is adhesive-set clay tiles with parameters determined from published experimental studies.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The building archetype may not represent the diversity of real-world residential structures and ages within a community. Further, the study does not account for complex terrain effects on wind loads, potentially limiting the applicability of the findings to more varied real-world scenarios. Though the tiles' fragilities are taken from experimental data, the authors acknowledge this is among the first to analyze the fragility of clay tiles, implying there's a lack of established comparison data.",
