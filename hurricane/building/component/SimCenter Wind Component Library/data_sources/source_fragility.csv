RWC.001,0,Peak Internal Force,kN,0,1,normal,5.84,0.1,Roof-Wall Connection - General fragility,"The study uses a light-frame residential building archetype to assess hurricane damage in Port St. Lucie, FL. Damage analysis described in this study does not explicitly model or account for the effects of wind-borne debris. The archetype building is 8.5m (28 ft) by 12.2m (40 ft), one story, with a mean roof height of 3.8m (12.5 ft) and a roof type of 6:12 slope gable roof without overhang. Roof sheathing panels are nailed at a spacing of 150mm at the edges. The steel fasteners used are assumed to be hot-dip galvanized to ASTM A153, Class D, with a zinc coating thickness of 43 mm. Panels are nailed to structural trusses or rafters made of spruce-pine-fir (SPF) lumber, spaced 0.6m on center with a specific gravity of 0.36. 

LIMITATIONS: The building archetype may not represent the diversity of real-world residential structures and ages within a community.

Additionally, they do not give a detailed physical description of the straps themselves, such as their dimensions, material, or specific installation methods. The focus is on the functional capacity of the connection rather than a precise engineering specification of the strap itself.

In individual tests, the predominant failure mode observed was nail pullout from the top plate. In system tests, where multiple rafters were toe-nailed to a continuous top plate, load-sharing behavior was observed, with the equivalent rafter load exceeding the capacity of the individual toe-nailed connection. However, the ultimate capacities remained low compared to connections with straps or adhesives.

Damage analysis described in this study does not explicitly model or account for the effects of wind-borne debris. The archetype building is 8.5m (28 ft) by 12.2m (40 ft), one story, with a mean roof height of 3.8m (12.5 ft). A window size of 3.72 square meters with 3.175 mm thick glass was considered. The authors used the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E-1300 (2003) to specify the strength of annealed glass under uniform wind pressure with a 60-second load duration and a probability of failure of 0.0081. The 60-second resistance value of annealed glass was converted to a 3-second strength by multiplying it by a factor of 1.21. This conversion was done to be consistent with the 3-second gust wind used in ASCE-7. A Weibull cumulative distribution was used to model the probability of failure of the brittle material (glass) under uniform wind load. This is stated as a common model for defining the failure probability of brittle materials like glass. The coefficient of variation of glass strength was noted to be in the range of 0.22–0.27.

LIMITATIONS: The building archetype may not represent the diversity of real-world residential structures and ages within a community. Further, the study does not account for complex terrain effects on wind loads, potentially limiting the applicability of the findings to more varied real-world scenarios. Finally, the fragility analysis mentions a specific window size (3.175 mm in 3.72 sq. m window) for calibration.

In the American wire gauge (AWG) system, an ""8d"" nail is a common size, typically referring to a nail that is approximately 2 1/2 inches (64 mm) long, and it will have a standardized diameter for this penny size. While the HAZUS model uses ""8d"" to differentiate between different roof sheathing connection strengths. 6/12 in nail pattern for roof sheathing with 6d nails most likely means that the 8d nails are spaced 6 inches apart along one axis of the sheathing panel and 12 inches apart along the perpendicular axis. This creates a grid pattern of nail fasteners securing the sheathing to the underlying roof structure. 

LIMITATIONS: The capacity function represents a simplification of real-world roof sheathing behavior, and the sources lack specific information on the test series or engineering analyses used to derive these parameters for this particular type of roof sheathing.",1 EA,1,vickery2006,Separation or pull off

Damage analysis described in this study does not explicitly model or account for the effects of wind-borne debris. The archetype building is 8.5m (28 ft) by 12.2m (40 ft), one story, with a mean roof height of 3.8m (12.5 ft) and a roof type of 6:12 slope gable roof without overhang. The roof covering is adhesive-set clay tiles with parameters determined from published experimental studies.

LIMITATIONS: The building archetype may not represent the diversity of real-world residential structures and ages within a community. Further, the study does not account for complex terrain effects on wind loads, potentially limiting the applicability of the findings to more varied real-world scenarios. Though the tiles' fragilities are taken from experimental data, the authors acknowledge this is among the first to analyze the fragility of clay tiles, implying there's a lack of established comparison data.",1 EA,1,"shdid2011,dong2016",Debonding of foam from ridge board
