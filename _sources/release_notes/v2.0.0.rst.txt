=============================
Version 2.0.0 (August 15, 2025)
=============================

This release marks a major milestone for the Damage and Loss Model Library and the beginning of a more frequent and structured release schedule. After more than two years of continuous development, ``v2.0.0`` introduces a significantly improved data schema, a host of new models, and a documentation system for model discovery.

For a comprehensive overview of the library in its current state, please see our completely revamped README.md.

Changed
-------

- **BREAKING:** The core data schema for models has been updated and rationalized to better support a wider range of hazards and asset types. Older custom tools that relied on the ``v1.0.0`` schema will need to be updated.

  - Renamed ``loss_repair.csv`` files to ``consequence_repair.csv`` for consistency
  - Updated loss measure units to use ratios instead of percentages for Hazus models
  - Improved data validation and multilinear CDF handling in model generation scripts

- **Code Quality:** Comprehensive code formatting and linting improvements using Ruff, enhancing maintainability and consistency across the entire codebase.

Added
-----

- **Model Library Expansion:**

  - **Hurricane Models:**

    - Added complete building models for **Hazus Hurricane v5.1** (both original and coupled versions)
    - Added **SimCenter Hurricane Wind Component Library** with comprehensive wind pressure components from peer-reviewed research

  - **Flood Models:**

    - Added complete building models for **Hazus Flood v6.1**

  - **Seismic Infrastructure Models:**

    - Added **Hazus Seismic Power Network** models (v5.1)
    - Added **Hazus Seismic Water Network** models (v6.1) 
    - Added **Hazus Seismic Transportation Network** models (v5.1)
    - Updated **Hazus Seismic Building** models to v6.1 (in addition to existing v5.1)
    - Added **Hazus Seismic Building Subassembly** models (v5.1)

- **Documentation System:**

  - Added an automated documentation website built with Sphinx that allows for easy discovery and exploration of all models in the library
  - Implemented custom Sphinx extensions for automatic generation of model documentation with fragility and consequence curves
  - Added caching system for efficient documentation builds

- **Metadata Enhancements:**

  - Added rich metadata, including clear citations, for every model to ensure proper credit and academic integrity
  - Enhanced model descriptions and parameter documentation

- **Configuration Files:**

  - Added Pelicun configuration files for all model libraries to facilitate integration with the Pelicun damage and loss assessment framework

Fixed
-----
