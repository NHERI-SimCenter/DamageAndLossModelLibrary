   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>NSA.AGR1</b> | Acceleration-Sensitive Nonstructural, Agriculture</p> 
   <div>

| Acceleration-Sensitive Nonstructural components include a large variety of different architectural, mechanical, and electrical components. Typical examples (based on Table 5.2 in the Hazus Earthquake Model Technical Manual): Cantilever elements and parapets, Racks and caibnets, Access floors, General mechanical, Manufacturing and process machinery, Piping systems, Storage tanks and spheres, HVAC systems, Elevators, Trussed towers, General electrical, and Lighting fixtures. Anchorage/bracing of nonstructural components improves earthquake performance of most components although routine or typical anchorage/bracing provides only limited damage protection. It is assumed that typical nonstructural components and building contents have limited anchorage/bracing.
| Damage to acceleration-sensitive components (e.g., mechanical equipment) is a function of the floor acceleration. The damage functions estimated for each group are assumed to be “typical” of its sub-components. However, that damage depends on the anchorage/bracing provided to the nonstructural components.
| Occupancy Type: Agriculture

| Acceleration-Sensitive Nonstructural components include a large variety of different architectural, mechanical, and electrical components. Typical examples (based on Table 5.2 in the Hazus Earthquake Model Technical Manual): Cantilever elements and parapets, Racks and caibnets, Access floors, General mechanical, Manufacturing and process machinery, Piping systems, Storage tanks and spheres, HVAC systems, Elevators, Trussed towers, General electrical, and Lighting fixtures. Anchorage/bracing of nonstructural components improves earthquake performance of most components although routine or typical anchorage/bracing provides only limited damage protection. It is assumed that typical nonstructural components and building contents have limited anchorage/bracing.
| Damage to acceleration-sensitive components (e.g., mechanical equipment) is a function of the floor acceleration. The damage functions estimated for each group are assumed to be “typical” of its sub-components. However, that damage depends on the anchorage/bracing provided to the nonstructural components.
| Occupancy Type: Multi-family Dwelling, Apartments, Condominiums
