The following models are available:

   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.W2.HC</b> | Structural, Wood, Greater than 5,000 Sq. Ft., High-Code</p> 
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: These buildings are typically commercial or industrial buildings, or multi-family residential buildings with a floor area greater than 5,000 square feet. These buildings include structural systems framed by beams or major horizontally spanning members over columns. These horizontal members may be glue- laminated (glu-lam) wood, solid-sawn wood beams, or wood trusses, or steel beams or trusses. Lateral loads usually are resisted by wood diaphragms and exterior walls sheathed with plywood, stucco, plaster, or other paneling. The walls may have diagonal rod bracing. Large openings for stores and garages often require post-and-beam framing. Lateral load resistance on those lines may be achieved with steel rigid frames (moment frames) or diagonal bracing.
| Design Level Approximate Basis:
| Post-1975 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 4, NEHRP Map Area 7.


Suggested Block Size: 1 EA (round up to integer quantity)

   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.W2.PC</b> | Structural, Wood, Greater than 5,000 Sq. Ft., Pre-Code</p>

| Design Level: Approximate Basis: UBC Seismic Zone 0, NEHRP Map Area 1.
| Pre-1941 construction in all other UBC and NEHRP areas.
| Pre-Code damage functions are appropriate for modeling older buildings that were not designed for earthquake load, regardless of where they are located in the United States.
