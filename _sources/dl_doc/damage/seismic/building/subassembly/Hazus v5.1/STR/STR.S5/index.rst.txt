   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.S5.LC</b> | Structural, Steel Frame with Unreinforced Masonry Infill Walls, Low-Rise, Low-Code</p> 
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: This is one of the older types of buildings. The infill walls usually are offset from the exterior frame members, wrap around them, and present a smooth masonry exterior with no indication of the frame. Solidly infilled masonry panels, when they fully engage the surrounding frame members (i.e., lie in the same plane), may provide stiffness and lateral load resistance to the structure.
| This is a “composite” structural system where the initial lateral resistance is provided by the infill walls. Upon cracking of the infills, further lateral resistance is provided by the steel frames “braced” by the infill walls acting as diagonal compression struts. Collapse of the structure results when the infill walls disintegrate (due to compression failure of the masonry “struts”) and the steel frame loses its stability.
| Low-Rise Building with 1-3 stories.
| Design Level Approximate Basis:
| 1941-1975 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 2B, NEHRP Map Area 5
| Post-1941 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 2A, NEHRP Map Area 4
| Post-1975 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 1, NEHRP Map Area 2/3


Suggested Block Size: 1 EA (round up to integer quantity)

| Low-Rise Building with 1-3 stories.
| Design Level: Approximate Basis: UBC Seismic Zone 0, NEHRP Map Area 1.
| Pre-1941 construction in all other UBC and NEHRP areas.
| Pre-Code damage functions are appropriate for modeling older buildings that were not designed for earthquake load, regardless of where they are located in the United States.
