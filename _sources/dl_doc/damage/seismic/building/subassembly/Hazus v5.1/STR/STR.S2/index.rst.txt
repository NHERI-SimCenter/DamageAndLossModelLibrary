The following models are available:


.. raw:: html

   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.S2.HC</b> | Structural, Steel Braced Frame, Low-Rise, High-Code</p> 
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel moment frame buildings except that the vertical components of the lateral force-resisting system are braced frames rather than moment frames.
| Low-Rise Building with 1-3 stories.
| Design Level Approximate Basis:
| Post-1975 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 4, NEHRP Map Area 7.


Suggested Block Size: 1 EA (round up to integer quantity)

| Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel moment frame buildings except that the vertical components of the lateral force-resisting system are braced frames rather than moment frames.
| Low-Rise Building with 1-3 stories.
| Design Level Approximate Basis:

   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.S2.PC</b> | Structural, Steel Braced Frame, Low-Rise, Pre-Code</p> 
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel moment frame buildings except that the vertical components of the lateral force-resisting system are braced frames rather than moment frames.
| Low-Rise Building with 1-3 stories.
| Design Level: Approximate Basis: UBC Seismic Zone 0, NEHRP Map Area 1.
| Pre-1941 construction in all other UBC and NEHRP areas.
| Pre-Code damage functions are appropriate for modeling older buildings that were not designed for earthquake load, regardless of where they are located in the United States.
