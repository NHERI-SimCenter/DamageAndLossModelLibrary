The following models are available:


.. raw:: html

   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.RM2.HC</b> | Structural, Reinforced Masonry Bearing Walls with Precast Concrete Diaphragms, Low-Rise, High-Code</p> 
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: These buildings have bearing walls similar to those of reinforced masonry bearing wall structures with wood or metal deck diaphragms, but the roof and floors are composed of precast concrete elements such as planks or tee-beams and the precast roof and floor elements are supported on interior beams and columns of steel or concrete (cast-in-place or precast). The precast horizontal elements often have a cast-in-place topping.
| Low-Rise Building with 1-3 stories.
| Design Level Approximate Basis:
| Post-1975 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 4, NEHRP Map Area 7.


Suggested Block Size: 1 EA (round up to integer quantity)

   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.RM2.PC</b> | Structural, Reinforced Masonry Bearing Walls with Precast Concrete Diaphragms, Low-Rise, Pre-Code</p> 
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: These buildings have bearing walls similar to those of reinforced masonry bearing wall structures with wood or metal deck diaphragms, but the roof and floors are composed of precast concrete elements such as planks or tee-beams and the precast roof and floor elements are supported on interior beams and columns of steel or concrete (cast-in-place or precast). The precast horizontal elements often have a cast-in-place topping.
| Low-Rise Building with 1-3 stories.
| Design Level: Approximate Basis: UBC Seismic Zone 0, NEHRP Map Area 1.
| Pre-1941 construction in all other UBC and NEHRP areas.
| Pre-Code damage functions are appropriate for modeling older buildings that were not designed for earthquake load, regardless of where they are located in the United States.
