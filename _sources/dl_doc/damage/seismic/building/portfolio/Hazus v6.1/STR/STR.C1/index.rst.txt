   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.C1.H.HC</b> | Structural, Reinforced Concrete Moment Resisting Frames, High-Rise, High-Code</p>
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel moment frame buildings except that the frames are reinforced concrete. There are a large variety of frame systems. Some older concrete frames may be proportioned and detailed such that brittle failure of the frame members can occur in earthquakes, leading to partial or full collapse of the buildings. Modern frames in zones of high seismicity are proportioned and detailed for ductile behavior and are likely to undergo large deformations during an earthquake without brittle failure of frame members or collapse.
| High-Rise Building with more than 8 stories.
| Design Level Approximate Basis:
| Post-1975 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 4, NEHRP Map Area 7.


Suggested Block Size: 1 EA (round up to integer quantity)
