   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.S4.H.HC</b> | Structural, Steel Frame with Cast-In-Place Concrete Shear Walls, High-Rise, High-Code</p> 
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.
| This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.
| High-Rise Building with more than 8 stories.
| Design Level Approximate Basis:
| Post-1975 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 4, NEHRP Map Area 7.


Suggested Block Size: 1 EA (round up to integer quantity)
