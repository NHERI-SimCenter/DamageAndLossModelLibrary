   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.PC2.H.HC</b> | Structural, Precast Concrete Frames with Concrete Shear Walls, High-Rise, High-Code</p> 
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: These buildings contain floor and roof diaphragms, typically composed of precast concrete elements with or without cast-in-place concrete topping slabs. Precast concrete girders and columns support the diaphragms. The girders often bear on column corbels. Closure strips between precast floor elements and beam-column joints are usually cast-in-place concrete. Welded steel inserts are often used to interconnect precast elements. Precast or cast-in-place concrete shear walls resist lateral loads. For buildings with precast frames and concrete shear walls to perform well, the details used to connect the structural elements must have sufficient strength and displacement capacity; however, in some cases, the connection details between the precast elements have negligible ductility.
| High-Rise Building with more than 8 stories.
| Design Level Approximate Basis:
| Post-1975 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 4, NEHRP Map Area 7.


Suggested Block Size: 1 EA (round up to integer quantity)
