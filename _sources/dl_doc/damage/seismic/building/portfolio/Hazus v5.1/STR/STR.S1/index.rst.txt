The following models are available:


.. raw:: html

   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>STR.S1.H.HC</b> | Structural, Steel Moment Frame, High-Rise, High-Code</p> 
   <div>

| Structural components represent the structural system in the building.
| Structural System: These buildings have a frame of steel columns and beams. In some cases, the beam-column connections have very small moment resisting capacity but, in other cases, some of the beams and columns are fully developed as moment frames to resist lateral forces. Usually, the structure is concealed on the outside by exterior nonstructural walls, which can be of almost any material (curtain walls, brick masonry, or precast concrete panels), and on the inside by ceilings and column furring. Diaphragms transfer lateral loads to moment-resisting frames. The diaphragms can be almost any material. The frames develop their stiffness by full or partial moment connections. The frames can be located almost anywhere in the building. Usually, the columns have their strong directions oriented so that some columns act primarily in one direction while the others act in the other direction. Steel moment frame buildings are typically more flexible than shear wall buildings. This low stiffness can result in large inter-story drifts that may lead to relatively greater nonstructural damage.
| High-Rise Building with more than 8 stories.
| Design Level Approximate Basis:
| Post-1975 construction in UBC Seismic Zone 4, NEHRP Map Area 7.


Suggested Block Size: 1 EA (round up to integer quantity)
