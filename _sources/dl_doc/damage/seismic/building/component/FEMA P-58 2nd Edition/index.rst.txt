FEMA P-58 2nd Edition
*********************

The models in this dataset are based on the 2nd edition of FEMA P-58. Specifically, the parameters are parsed from the FEMAP-58_FragilityDatabase_v3.1.2.xls file that is published as part of Volume 3 of the methodology. A few obvious typos and errors have been fixed in that file; these adjustments are captured in the changelog at https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/DamageAndLossModelLibrary/blob/main/data_sources/FEMA_P58/changelog.txt . Simultaneous damage states have been replaced with equivalent Mutually exclusive damage states. Component classification is based on UNIFORMAT II as per NISTIR 6389.
