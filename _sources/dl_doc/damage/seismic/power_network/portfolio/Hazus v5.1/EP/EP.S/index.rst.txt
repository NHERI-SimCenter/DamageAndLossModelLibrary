   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>EP.S.H.A</b> | Electrical Power, Substation, High Voltage, Anchored</p>
   <div>

| Substations can be entirely enclosed in buildings, where all the equipment is assembled into one metal clad unit. Other substations have step-down transformers, high voltage switches, oil circuit breakers, and lightning arrestors located outside the substation building. High voltage is 500 kV. The sub components are anchored.


Suggested Block Size: 1 EA (round up to integer quantity)
