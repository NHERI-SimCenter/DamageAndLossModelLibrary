   <p class="dl_comp_name"><b>RWC.straps.001</b> | Roof-Wall Connection with Straps</p>
   <div>

| The modeled failure mode related to this component would be the failure of the roof-to-wall connection under wind-induced uplift loads, potentially leading to roof deck or even complete roof failure, which are defined within the damage state descriptions. The installation of roof-to-wall straps is considered a mitigation option within the HAZUS-MH model, specifically for single-family residential buildings that currently have toe-nailed roof-wall connections. 
| LIMITATIONS: A limitation of this capacity function, as with other component resistances in the model, lies in the fact that these are statistical representations based on laboratory data, engineering analyses, and sometimes engineering judgment. Additionally, they do not give a detailed physical description of the straps themselves, such as their dimensions, material, or specific installation methods. The focus is on the functional capacity of the connection rather than a precise engineering specification of the strap itself. The underlying details of what constitutes a "strap" in the model's calculations are likely based on engineering standards and typical construction practices, but these specifics are not elaborated upon in the provided excerpts.
