| The study uses a light-frame residential building archetype to assess hurricane damage in Port St. Lucie, FL. Damage analysis described in this study does not explicitly model or account for the effects of wind-borne debris. The archetype building is 8.5m (28 ft) by 12.2m (40 ft), one story, with a mean roof height of 3.8m (12.5 ft). The authors used the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E-1300 (2003) to specify the strength of annealed glass under uniform wind pressure with a 60-second load duration and a probability of failure of 0.0081. The 60-second resistance value of annealed glass was converted to a 3-second strength by multiplying it by a factor of 1.21. This conversion was done to be consistent with the 3-second gust wind used in ASCE-7. A Weibull cumulative distribution was used to model the probability of failure of the brittle material (glass) under uniform wind load. This is stated as a common model for defining the failure probability of brittle materials like glass. The coefficient of variation of glass strength was noted to be in the range of 0.22–0.27.
| LIMITATIONS: The building archetype may not represent the diversity of real-world residential structures and ages within a community. Further, the study does not account for complex terrain effects on wind loads, potentially limiting the applicability of the findings to more varied real-world scenarios. ASTM E-1300 specifies strength under uniform wind pressure. However, wind loads on buildings, especially during hurricanes, can be complex and non-uniform, with varying pressures at different locations on a window. Additionally, while the study converts the 60-second resistance to a 3-second strength, this conversion factor is an approximation. The actual behavior of glass under different load durations might be more complex. Additionally, the strength of weathered or previously damaged glass might be lower than that of new, undamaged glass, which is likely what ASTM standards address. This time-dependent degradation of glass strength is not explicitly considered.

| This is the general representation of single-glazed (SG) doors as a specific type of door component, which would include sliding glass doors with single panes of glass. The primary failure mode considered for the SG door under pressure is pressure-induced failure, where the wind load acting on the door exceeds its resistance capacity, leading to a breach in the building envelope. This breach can then affect internal pressure and potentially lead to further damage.
| LIMITATIONS: The sources do not explicitly specify the precise type of entry door that this capacity function considers. Resistances assigned to building components are based on results from laboratory test data, engineering analyses coupled with laboratory data, and in some cases, engineering judgment. The model might not fully capture the wide variety of SG door constructions, installation methods, the condition of the door and its frame, or the complexities of failure mechanisms that can occur during a hurricane. Further, the lack of specific details about the test series or engineering analyses used to derive these fragility parameters for SG doors, makes it difficult to fully understand the empirical or analytical basis for this specific capacity function.
