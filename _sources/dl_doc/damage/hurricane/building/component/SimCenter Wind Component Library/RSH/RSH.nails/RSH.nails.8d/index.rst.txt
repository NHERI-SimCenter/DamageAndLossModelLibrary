   <div>

| The HAZUS model considers plywood and oriented strand board (OSB) as typical materials for roof sheathing panels. In the American wire gauge (AWG) system, an "8d" nail is a common size, typically referring to a nail that is approximately 2 1/2 inches (64 mm) long, and it will have a standardized diameter for this penny size. While the HAZUS model uses "8d" to differentiate between different roof sheathing connection strengths. 6/12 in nail pattern for roof sheathing with 6d nails most likely means that the 8d nails are spaced 6 inches apart along one axis of the sheathing panel and 12 inches apart along the perpendicular axis. This creates a grid pattern of nail fasteners securing the sheathing to the underlying roof structure. 
| LIMITATIONS: The capacity function represents a simplification of real-world roof sheathing behavior, and the sources lack specific information on the test series or engineering analyses used to derive these parameters for this particular type of roof sheathing.
