    Automatically creates a performance model for PGA-based Hazus EQ analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    AIM: dict
        Asset Information Model - provides features of the asset that can be
        used to infer attributes of the performance model.

    Returns
    -------
    GI_ap: dict
        Extended General Information - extends the GI from the input AIM with
        additional inferred features. These features are typically used in
        intermediate steps during the auto-population and are not required
        for the performance assessment. They are returned to allow reviewing
        how these latent variables affect the final results.
    DL_ap: dict
        Damage and Loss parameters - these define the performance model and
        details of the calculation.
    CMP: DataFrame
        Component assignment - Defines the components (in rows) and their
        location, direction, and quantity (in columns).
