<div class="line">Structural System: The vertical components of the lateral force-resisting system in these buildings are concrete shear walls that are usually bearing walls. In older buildings, the walls often are quite extensive, and the wall stresses are low, but reinforcing is light. In newer buildings, the shear walls often are limited in extent, generating concerns about boundary members and overturning forces.</div>

<div class="line">Structural System: The vertical components of the lateral force-resisting system in these buildings are concrete shear walls that are usually bearing walls. In older buildings, the walls often are quite extensive, and the wall stresses are low, but reinforcing is light. In newer buildings, the shear walls often are limited in extent, generating concerns about boundary members and overturning forces.</div>

<div class="line">Structural System: The vertical components of the lateral force-resisting system in these buildings are concrete shear walls that are usually bearing walls. In older buildings, the walls often are quite extensive, and the wall stresses are low, but reinforcing is light. In newer buildings, the shear walls often are limited in extent, generating concerns about boundary members and overturning forces.</div>

In older buildings, the walls often are quite extensive, and the wall stresses are low, but reinforcing is light. In newer buildings, the shear walls often are limited in extent, generating concerns about boundary members and overturning forces.</div>
