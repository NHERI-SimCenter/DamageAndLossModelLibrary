<div class="line">Structural components represent the structural system in the building.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: These are typically single-family or small, multi-family dwellings of not more than 5,000 square feet of floor area and 1-2 stories. The essential structural feature of these buildings is repetitive framing by wood rafters or joists on wood stud walls. Loads are light and spans are small. These buildings may have relatively heavy masonry chimneys and may be partially or fully covered with masonry veneer. Most of these buildings, especially the single-family residences, are not engineered but constructed in accordance with “conventional construction” provisions of building codes. Hence, they usually have the components of a lateral-force-resisting system even though it may be incomplete. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to shear walls. The diaphragms are roof panels and floors that may be sheathed with sawn lumber, plywood or fiberboard sheathing. Shear walls are sheathed with boards, stucco, plaster, plywood, gypsum board, particle board, or fiberboard, or interior partition walls sheathed with plaster or gypsum board.</div>

<div class="line">Structural System: These are typically single-family or small, multi-family dwellings of not more than 5,000 square feet of floor area and 1-2 stories. The essential structural feature of these buildings is repetitive framing by wood rafters or joists on wood stud walls. Loads are light and spans are small. These buildings may have relatively heavy masonry chimneys and may be partially or fully covered with masonry veneer. Most of these buildings, especially the single-family residences, are not engineered but constructed in accordance with “conventional construction” provisions of building codes. Hence, they usually have the components of a lateral-force-resisting system even though it may be incomplete. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to shear walls. The diaphragms are roof panels and floors that may be sheathed with sawn lumber, plywood or fiberboard sheathing. Shear walls are sheathed with boards, stucco, plaster, plywood, gypsum board, particle board, or fiberboard, or interior partition walls sheathed with plaster or gypsum board.</div>

<div class="line">Structural System: These are typically single-family or small, multi-family dwellings of not more than 5,000 square feet of floor area and 1-2 stories. The essential structural feature of these buildings is repetitive framing by wood rafters or joists on wood stud walls. Loads are light and spans are small. These buildings may have relatively heavy masonry chimneys and may be partially or fully covered with masonry veneer. Most of these buildings, especially the single-family residences, are not engineered but constructed in accordance with “conventional construction” provisions of building codes. Hence, they usually have the components of a lateral-force-resisting system even though it may be incomplete. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to shear walls. The diaphragms are roof panels and floors that may be sheathed with sawn lumber, plywood or fiberboard sheathing. Shear walls are sheathed with boards, stucco, plaster, plywood, gypsum board, particle board, or fiberboard, or interior partition walls sheathed with plaster or gypsum board.</div>

<div class="line">Structural System: These are typically single-family or small, multi-family dwellings of not more than 5,000 square feet of floor area and 1-2 stories. The essential structural feature of these buildings is repetitive framing by wood rafters or joists on wood stud walls. Loads are light and spans are small. These buildings may have relatively heavy masonry chimneys and may be partially or fully covered with masonry veneer. Most of these buildings, especially the single-family residences, are not engineered but constructed in accordance with “conventional construction” provisions of building codes. Hence, they usually have the components of a lateral-force-resisting system even though it may be incomplete. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to shear walls. The diaphragms are roof panels and floors that may be sheathed with sawn lumber, plywood or fiberboard sheathing. Shear walls are sheathed with boards, stucco, plaster, plywood, gypsum board, particle board, or fiberboard, or interior partition walls sheathed with plaster or gypsum board.</div>
