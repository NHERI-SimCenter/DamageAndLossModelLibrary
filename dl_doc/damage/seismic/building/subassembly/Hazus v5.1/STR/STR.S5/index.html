<div class="line">Structural components represent the structural system in the building.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: This is one of the older types of buildings. The infill walls usually are offset from the exterior frame members, wrap around them, and present a smooth masonry exterior with no indication of the frame. Solidly infilled masonry panels, when they fully engage the surrounding frame members (i.e., lie in the same plane), may provide stiffness and lateral load resistance to the structure.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the initial lateral resistance is provided by the infill walls. Upon cracking of the infills, further lateral resistance is provided by the steel frames “braced” by the infill walls acting as diagonal compression struts. Collapse of the structure results when the infill walls disintegrate (due to compression failure of the masonry “struts”) and the steel frame loses its stability.</div>

<div class="line">Structural components represent the structural system in the building.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: This is one of the older types of buildings. The infill walls usually are offset from the exterior frame members, wrap around them, and present a smooth masonry exterior with no indication of the frame. Solidly infilled masonry panels, when they fully engage the surrounding frame members (i.e., lie in the same plane), may provide stiffness and lateral load resistance to the structure.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the initial lateral resistance is provided by the infill walls. Upon cracking of the infills, further lateral resistance is provided by the steel frames “braced” by the infill walls acting as diagonal compression struts. Collapse of the structure results when the infill walls disintegrate (due to compression failure of the masonry “struts”) and the steel frame loses its stability.</div>
