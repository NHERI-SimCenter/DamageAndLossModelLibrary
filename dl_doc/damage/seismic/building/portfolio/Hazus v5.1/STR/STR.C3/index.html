<div class="line">Structural components represent the structural system in the building.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel frame buildings with unreinforced masonry infill walls except that the frame is of reinforced concrete. In these buildings, the shear strength of the columns, after cracking of the infill, may limit the semi-ductile behavior of the system.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the initial lateral resistance is provided by the infill walls. Upon cracking of the infills, further lateral resistance is provided by the concrete frame, “braced” by the infill, acting as diagonal compression struts. Collapse of the structure results when the infill walls disintegrate (due to compression failure of the masonry “struts”) and the frame loses stability, or when the concrete columns suffer shear failures due to reduced effective height and the high shear forces imposed on them by the masonry compression struts.</div>

<div class="line">Structural components represent the structural system in the building.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel frame buildings with unreinforced masonry infill walls except that the frame is of reinforced concrete. In these buildings, the shear strength of the columns, after cracking of the infill, may limit the semi-ductile behavior of the system.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the initial lateral resistance is provided by the infill walls. Upon cracking of the infills, further lateral resistance is provided by the concrete frame, “braced” by the infill, acting as diagonal compression struts. Collapse of the structure results when the infill walls disintegrate (due to compression failure of the masonry “struts”) and the frame loses stability, or when the concrete columns suffer shear failures due to reduced effective height and the high shear forces imposed on them by the masonry compression struts.</div>
<div class="line">High-Rise Building with more than 8 stories.</div>
<div class="line">Design Level: Approximate Basis: UBC Seismic Zone 0, NEHRP Map Area 1.</div>
<div class="line">Pre-1941 construction in all other UBC and NEHRP areas.</div>
<div class="line">Pre-Code damage functions are appropriate for modeling older buildings that were not designed for earthquake load, regardless of where they are located in the United States.</div>

<div class="line">Structural components represent the structural system in the building.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel frame buildings with unreinforced masonry infill walls except that the frame is of reinforced concrete. In these buildings, the shear strength of the columns, after cracking of the infill, may limit the semi-ductile behavior of the system.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the initial lateral resistance is provided by the infill walls. Upon cracking of the infills, further lateral resistance is provided by the concrete frame, “braced” by the infill, acting as diagonal compression struts. Collapse of the structure results when the infill walls disintegrate (due to compression failure of the masonry “struts”) and the frame loses stability, or when the concrete columns suffer shear failures due to reduced effective height and the high shear forces imposed on them by the masonry compression struts.</div>

<div class="line">Structural components represent the structural system in the building.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel frame buildings with unreinforced masonry infill walls except that the frame is of reinforced concrete. In these buildings, the shear strength of the columns, after cracking of the infill, may limit the semi-ductile behavior of the system.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the initial lateral resistance is provided by the infill walls. Upon cracking of the infills, further lateral resistance is provided by the concrete frame, “braced” by the infill, acting as diagonal compression struts. Collapse of the structure results when the infill walls disintegrate (due to compression failure of the masonry “struts”) and the frame loses stability, or when the concrete columns suffer shear failures due to reduced effective height and the high shear forces imposed on them by the masonry compression struts.</div>
<div class="line">Low-Rise Building with 1-3 stories.</div>
<div class="line">Design Level: Approximate Basis: UBC Seismic Zone 0, NEHRP Map Area 1.</div>
<div class="line">Pre-1941 construction in all other UBC and NEHRP areas.</div>
<div class="line">Pre-Code damage functions are appropriate for modeling older buildings that were not designed for earthquake load, regardless of where they are located in the United States.</div>

<div class="line">Structural components represent the structural system in the building.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel frame buildings with unreinforced masonry infill walls except that the frame is of reinforced concrete. In these buildings, the shear strength of the columns, after cracking of the infill, may limit the semi-ductile behavior of the system.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the initial lateral resistance is provided by the infill walls. Upon cracking of the infills, further lateral resistance is provided by the concrete frame, “braced” by the infill, acting as diagonal compression struts. Collapse of the structure results when the infill walls disintegrate (due to compression failure of the masonry “struts”) and the frame loses stability, or when the concrete columns suffer shear failures due to reduced effective height and the high shear forces imposed on them by the masonry compression struts.</div>

<div class="line">Structural components represent the structural system in the building.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: These buildings are similar to steel frame buildings with unreinforced masonry infill walls except that the frame is of reinforced concrete. In these buildings, the shear strength of the columns, after cracking of the infill, may limit the semi-ductile behavior of the system.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the initial lateral resistance is provided by the infill walls. Upon cracking of the infills, further lateral resistance is provided by the concrete frame, “braced” by the infill, acting as diagonal compression struts. Collapse of the structure results when the infill walls disintegrate (due to compression failure of the masonry “struts”) and the frame loses stability, or when the concrete columns suffer shear failures due to reduced effective height and the high shear forces imposed on them by the masonry compression struts.</div>
<div class="line">Mid-Rise Building with 4-7 stories.</div>
<div class="line">Design Level: Approximate Basis: UBC Seismic Zone 0, NEHRP Map Area 1.</div>
<div class="line">Pre-1941 construction in all other UBC and NEHRP areas.</div>
<div class="line">Pre-Code damage functions are appropriate for modeling older buildings that were not designed for earthquake load, regardless of where they are located in the United States.</div>
