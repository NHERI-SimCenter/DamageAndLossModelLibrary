<div class="line">Structural System: These buildings have bearing walls similar to those of reinforced masonry bearing wall structures with wood or metal deck diaphragms, but the roof and floors are composed of precast concrete elements such as planks or tee-beams and the precast roof and floor elements are supported on interior beams and columns of steel or concrete (cast-in-place or precast). The precast horizontal elements often have a cast-in-place topping.</div>
