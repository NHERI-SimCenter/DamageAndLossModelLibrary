<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>

<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lifeline Facility damage functions are expressed in terms of an equivalent value of PGA for efficient evaluation of buildings that are components of utility and transportation systems. Only structural damage functions are developed based on PGA, since structural damage is considered the most appropriate measure of damage for utility and transportation system facilities. Median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. Spectrum shape is influenced by earthquake source (i.e., WUS vs. CEUS attenuation functions), earthquake magnitude (e.g., large vs. small magnitude events), distance from source to site, site conditions (e.g., soil vs. rock), and effective damping, which varies based on building properties and earthquake duration (e.g., short, moderate, or long duration). These fragility curves were developed for a single set of spectrum shape factors (a reference spectrum), and a formula is provided for modifying damage state medians to approximate other spectrum shapes. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large magnitude (i.e., M7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km or greater.</div>
<div class="line">Structural System: The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Diaphragms of almost any material transfer lateral loads to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In modern “dual” systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls.</div>
<div class="line">This is a “composite” structural system where the concrete shear walls are the primary lateral force- resisting system. Hence, Slight, Moderate, and Extensive damage states are likely to be determined by damage to the shear walls, while the Complete damage state would be determined by the failure of the structural frame.</div>
